					<p>Stephen Lee started working in his early years. As a 14 year old youth he took interest in the influencial power that
						educators carried, and began modeling his young life in a similar fasion. At 15 Stephen was given the oportunity to
						mentor fellow youth in the field of shooting sports (Rifle, and shotgun shooting). The pressure put on his shoulders
						was irregular for a typical 15 year old, but it was during this stressful period in his life that he was able to grow
						both in his own abilities, and in his confidence. Stephen worked mentoring youth, and teaching them firearm safety
						through the remainder of his teen years. As an adult he was able to influence the program even further by becoming
						the director of the shooting sports program for "Scofield Scout Camp". These building blocks were pivotal in building
						his work ethic, and social attitude.</p>
					<p>Since working with youth Stephen has had many oportunities to prove himself in the working field, working as the manager
						for multiple food industry chains, and has the talent of climbing the corperate ladder of any industry he finds himself
						in.
						<br>In his free time, Stephen often spends time with his wife, and beautiful daughter. They enjoy most outdoor activities,
						including fishing, hunting, and shotgun shooting. Grateful for the wonderful life he has been given, Stephen strives
						to help those around him, and hopes that all people will feel welcomed and cared for.</p>
